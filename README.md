# Kottans Git Course
## Git Basics

Describe 2 or 3 things that:
- were new to you - ```git reflog```, @ as HEAD
- were familiar but you have seen them at a different angle - ```git stash```, ```git reset```
- were not so easy to master or comprehend - ```git rebase```

## Git Collaboration
I did this and previous modules as one and in order not to repeat about things that I learned, I would like to say *"thank you, __kottans__!"* for your job :)
